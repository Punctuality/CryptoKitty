CryptoGraphy in lovely pictures. Love for everyone.

Encoder encode image in stegmography way, and gives an oppurtunity to write some text into image. Decoder decode text from encoded image.

Encoder inputs: 1. File path to origin image 2. File path for saving encoded image. (Without .format cause its only .bmp) 3. Text to write.

Decoder inputs: 1. File path for extracting text from saved image. (Without .format cause its only .bmp) 2. File path for saving big text without printing (more than 2*10^4 symbls).

Also there is low_lib version without non-standart libs.

P.S. Don`t let Putin break ur privacy.
